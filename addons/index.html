		<h1>Addons</h1>
		<p>Here are some addons you can use for Fang's Heist to spice up your gameplay experience.</p>
		<p>All addons here are free to be modified, shared, and/or maintained by anybody.</p>
		<p>To download them, if you are an SRB2 kid that doesn't know how to do anything without a big "dash forward" button slapped in front of your face. Click the green links to download their respective mods.</p>
		<p>If you want your mod to be displayed on this page, contact me at @saxashitter on Discord.</p>
		<p style="color: red; font-style: italic">If the mod downloads as ".pk3.zip", simply remove the ".zip" from the filename. This shouldn't cause any errors or conflicts.</p>

		<h2><a style="font-style: italic; color: #00FF00" href="/assets/addons/FHC_BonusPregame.pk3" download>Bonus Pregame</a></h2>
		<h3 style="font-style: italic; color: yellow">Created by I.D.K (hyperstar)</h1>
		<p>Adds Pregame backgrounds for select modded characters. Most of the mods made by the big guys are here. This was made pretty early during Heist's alpha. In fact, it was made shortly after I introduced Pregame and teams. It is still actively maintained by it's owner, and any updates will be uploaded here. This should be active on the official Platinum Online server, so go check it out there.</p>

		<h2><a style="font-style: italic; color: #00FF00" href="/assets/addons/FHG_WarioLand.pk3" download>Wario Land Gamemode</a></h2>
		<h3 style="font-style: italic; color: yellow">Created by TwoTailedHero</h1>
		<p>Adds a new gamemode, reminiscent to Wario Land 4. Basically, it shows Fang's Heist it's father. This was originally going to be included within the mod itself, but to not overcomplicate things, and to not try and bloat version 1, it was removed. I decided it would be best to keep it as it's own separate addon, so others can use it as an example for custom gametypes, or host with it on their servers.</p>
